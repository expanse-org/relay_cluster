# Loopring Relay Cluster

### Introduction

Loopring Relay is an important part of Loopring’s technology and ecosystem. It centralizes the management of offline order pools, broadcasts Loopring’s orders, and provides complete back-end services for exchanges and wallets. Based on the centralized system, we use the order broadcasting system to share orders to multiple relays to implement a network-wide order pool.
